            <div class="copy"><p> Welcome to CS 189! We are excited to have you as we embark upon a survey of both classical and modern machine learning methods. Please note that this semester, there are two iterations of CS 189: one taught by Professor Shewchuk and the other taught by Marvin Zhang. This website pertains to information regarding Marvin's version of the course. </p> <h3> Course Overview </h3> <p> Below is a very general overview the course. Please note that this overview is tentative and may be subject to change </p> <p> Week 0: Introduction and Math Review </p> <p> Week 1: Maximum Likelihood Estimation </p> <p> Week 2: Linear Regression and MAP Estimation </p> <p> Week 3: Logistic Regression </p> <p> Week 4: Support Vector Machines </p> <p> Week 5: Kernels </p> <p> Week 6: Analytical Techniques in ML </p> <p> Week 7: Midterm Review </p> <p> Week 8: Nearest Neighbors and Decision Trees </p> <p> Week 9: Unsupervised Learning Methods </p> <p> Week 10: Neural Networks </p> <p> Week 11: Convolutional Neural Networks </p> <p> Week 12: Transformers </p> <p> Week 13: Special Topics </p> <h3> Remote Instruction </h3> <p> Due to the COVID-19 Pandemic, UC Berkeley has mandated 2 weeks of remote instruction, with plans to hopefully begin in-person lecture by January 31. Therefore, the first two weeks of CS 189 will be on Zoom. We will continuously monitor the situation closely and will work to provide the best possible learning environment for our students throughout the semester.</div>

            <div class="copy"></p><h3>Piazza</h3><p>We will use Piazza as the "one-stop shop" throughout the semester: for a Q&A forum and for official announcements. Enrollment in Piazza is mandatory. If you have not yet been added to the CS 189 (CDSS) Piazza, please email cs189-cdss-sp22 (at) berkeley (dot) edu. If you have questions about anything related to the course, please post them on Piazza rather than emailing the instructor or TAs. Please do not post anything resembling a solution to a homework problem before it's due. If in doubt, you should make your post private (visible to instructors only). We always welcome any feedback on what we could be doing better. You are required to use your actual name on Piazza.</p><h3>Gradescope</h3><p>All homework will be submitted through Gradescope, and all grades will be returned through Gradescope. If you have not been added to Gradescope, please email cs189-cdss-sp22 (at) berkeley (dot) edu.</p><h3> bCourses </h3> <p> We will use bCourses to upload lecture recordings for this course and solutions to problem sets. If you are in the course, you should have automatically been added to bCourses. If you cannot access the bCourses site, please email cs189-cdss-sp22 (at) berkeley (dot) edu. </p> <h3>Instructional Servers</h3><p>This course does not make use of instructional accounts, but if you would like a computer account for this course, go to <a href='http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/webacct'>http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/webacct</a>, or click 'WebAcct' on <a href='http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu'>http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu</a>.</p></div>

            <h3>Homeworks</h3>
            <div class="copy"><p> There are 7 homeworks for this class, which are released roughly 1.5 weeks at a time. Readers will grade homeworks throughout the semester, and grades will be released on Gradescope. <b> If you wish to request a regrade on a homework assignment, you have 5 days to do so. </b> Any regrade requests after this time window will not be considered by course staff. Doing the homeworks and reading the solutions is vital for your learning. You are expected to show your work and justify all of your answers. Your lowest two homework scores will be dropped, but these two drops should be reserved for emergencies. We will not grant additional homework drops or homework extensions for any reason.</p></div>

            </h2>
            <div class="copy"><p>Ethical behavior is an important part of being an engineer. It is a part of our responsibility to act ethically and honestly, and moreover, ethical behavior is what helps you learn best. Cheating is fundamentally dishonest and antisocial behavior. We have a zero-tolerance policy for cheating. Any offense will result in negative points for the category that the offense occurs in, with no bound on how negative it can go, and a referral to the Center for Student Conduct.<br/><br/>You are not permitted to upload any of our problems, solutions, or your own solutions to our problems to any site that is accessible by other people. Use Piazza to discuss content. The only limited exceptions to this are online communication mediums between you and the collaborating individuals explicitly listed on your homework assignment. Looking at online solutions from previous semesters or other students is forbidden, as is sharing of your solutions with others. Furthermore, students all have an affirmative duty to report possible cases of cheating or unauthorized communication to the course staff, immediately. Acknowledgement of and failure to report cheating implicates the bystander since this is academic misconduct. Cheating hurts us all and engineering ethics requires us to point out wrongdoing when we are aware of it.</p></div>

                <div class="copy">
                <p>You are encouraged to work on homework problems in study groups of up to five people, however, <b>you must always write up the solutions on your own</b>. You are not permitted to look at the final written solution even for members of your own study group. Similarly, you may use books or online resources (not solutions from previous terms) to help solve homework problems, but <b>you must always credit all such sources in your writeup and you must never copy material verbatim</b>. We believe that most students can distinguish between helping other students and cheating. Explaining the meaning of a question, discussing a way of approaching a solution, or collaboratively exploring how to solve a problem within your group is an interaction that we strongly encourage. But you should write your homework solution strictly by yourself. You must explicitly acknowledge everyone whom you have worked with or who has given you any significant ideas about the homework.</p>
