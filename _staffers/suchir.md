Hi! I’m Suchir, a 4th year math and CS major. This is my third semester on staff for 189, and I’m super excited to be here. I'm part of Jennifer's research group, so my work broadly falls under computational biology. A bit more about me: I hail from Pennsylvania, am an avid classical music enthusiast, and enjoy my time in CSM (best club on campus!). I’m excited to meet you all and hope you have a great semester.
