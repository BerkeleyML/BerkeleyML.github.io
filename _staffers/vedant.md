hi! i'm vedant, currently a senior here studying CS. outside of school, i like bouldering, recently got into running, enjoy cooking new meals, and love watching horror movies. my academic background tends to be more on the ML side (hence this class), and i've applied a lot of ML to my internships at some finance places. reach out if you want to chat about anything or want advice!
