Hi! I'm Nishant, and I'm a 3rd year majoring in CS and physics from Washington. I enjoy building things and finding interesting applications of ML and AI. In my free time, I do competitive programming, binge TV shows, listen to music, and go hiking. Looking forward to meeting everyone this semester!
