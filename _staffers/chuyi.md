Hi! Iâ€™m Chuyi, a junior majoring in CS and Economics. My primary interests include machine learning and education, where I work on instructional video understanding. In my free time, I enjoy playing the electric guitar, watching sports, and exploring the depths of Wikipedia. Reach out to me for anything!
