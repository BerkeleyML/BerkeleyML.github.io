’Sup! I’m Kev, a 4th year undergrad studying EECS. My interests lie in robotics, computer vision, and Tetris, and in my free time you might catch me playing badminton or cooking. In previous semesters I TA’d for CS 70, but I’m a big fan of this course and I’m super excited to have you as part of it too!
