Hi! Iâ€™m Grace, a third year EECS PhD student in computer vision. My primary research interests lie in studying multimodal vision and language models as well as knowledge in generative models. In my free time I like to run, listen to podcasts about art history and the internet, and write songs on my ukulele.
