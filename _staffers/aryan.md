Hey everyone! My name is Aryan and I am a 4th year EECS major from Minnesota. My research involves robot learning and few-shot learning for computer vision, but I am also interested in generative AI. Outside of school, I like photography, random board games and I am trying to learn tennis. Feel free to reach out if you want to chat about anything :)
